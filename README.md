# Book-Recommendation-System
This project implements a book recommendation system using collaborative filtering with k-nearest neighbors (kNN). It analyzes user ratings and suggests books based on similarity scores, helping users discover new books they may enjoy. The model uses a user-item matrix and cosine similarity to find similar books.
